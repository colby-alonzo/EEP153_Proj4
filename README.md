# EEP 153 Final Project: Nutritional Policy Analysis in Ethiopia

This project examines strategies to reduce undernutrition in Ethiopia through economic and nutritional policy modeling. Using household-level consumption data and nutrient composition tables, we simulate how policy interventions affect dietary adequacy.

## Project Goals

- Identify key nutritional deficiencies among low-income Ethiopian households  
- Evaluate how income and price constraints shape food demand and nutrient intake  
- Design and simulate policies aimed at improving nutritional outcomes

## Core Policies Explored

- **Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs):** Raising household purchasing power to improve overall diet quality  
- **Biofortification:** Increasing nutrient density in commonly consumed foods to target specific deficiencies
- **Milk Supply Subsidy:** Reducing the market price of milk to support calcium and protein intake  
- **Forestry Support Policy:** Promoting access to nutrient-dense forest foods (like leafy greens) by improving conservation and collection access

## Topics Covered

- Structural demand systems  
- Income and price elasticity of food demand  
- Nutrient adequacy and dietary shortfalls  
- Policy counterfactuals and household-level simulation

## Methods

- Regression-based demand estimation  
- Utility modeling (Marshallian and Hicksian demand)  
- Nutrient adequacy ratio analysis  
- Scenario simulations with adjusted budgets and nutrient compositions

## Deliverables

- Policy impact visualizations (demand curves, adequacy plots)  
- Interactive functions for simulating and visualizing household responses  
- Final presentation summarizing findings and recommendations
